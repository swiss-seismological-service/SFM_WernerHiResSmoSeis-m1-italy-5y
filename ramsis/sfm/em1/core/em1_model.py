EM1 model code that uses hydraulic borehole data and a seismicity catalog
to forecast the number of events above a certain magnitude based on a
hydraulics plan.

# This model has been implemented in python, however it is not required
# to be in python. If it is in another language, a system call will probably
# be made from the ../server/model_adaptor.py to your model. Your model
# may require alterations to what data is available from RAMSIS, so the
# example model adaptor may provide a guide to you on what default
# functions are availble.
